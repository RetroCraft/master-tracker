# Keys

On 12/28, the second (out of three) beta gate opened which displayed 3 keys to be solved.

### **1: no crash ftw**

For this first key, a picture was provided that said "watch this video:" and then had a YouTube video link. Theorists found that they did not have to watch the video, but instead turn up the exposure to reveal a message around the corners that had a message that stated you did not have to actually watch the video. At the bottom left corner, it stated that your password is "NO CRASH FTW".

### **2: marioriomaoooo**

For the second key, TheTheoristGateway took you back to the "youareprepared" video and gave you a legend to decipher the blinking lights at the beginning of the video. Theorists quickly decyphered this and found this to be the answer when going frame by frame using the legend.

### **3: 756e627265616b61626c65**

This one stumped a lot of people. Theorists were orignally given a video that showed the text "leave. no. stone. unturned." and then flashing green lines under letters. Theorists found that this was showing a link and led to unturnnostone.com which showed a link with question marks as an extension. Clicking on it brought you to a page with a bunch of stones and then the question marks. Some theorists found that this was to show a pattern.

The Red Questionmark Pattern: Add 2 starting from A each time until you get to the "?"

The Green Questionmark Pattern: Subtract 3 starting from Z each time until you get to the "?"

![](https://www.unturnnostone.com/thethirdstones.gif)

The Blue Questionmark Pattern: A +1 +2 +3 +4.. and so on until you get to the "?"

The Orange Questionmark Pattern: Skip two letters starting from AB until you get to the "?"

The Yellow Questionmark Pattern: Start with ZA and add a letter respectively in pairs until you get to the "?"

The Purple Questionmark Pattern: +77 +66 +55 +44 +33.. and so on until you get to the "?"

The Black Questionmark Pattern: Addition is all you need to complete it!

These patterns resulted in you getting MHVYZTG30888, but plugging it in did not work. Theorists THEN found that it had to be lowercase to get to the correct place.
(Sidenote: Normally, websites that are run on WINDOWS have case INsensitive links, but if nothing else is set on other hosts, it will have to be case sensitive. Confirmation from CreatorINK is still awaiting on if this was on purpose)

After going to the website provided (https://www.unturnnostone.com/mhvyztg30888.gif), you got a lot more glyphs, but this time it stated that the password was "unbreakable". This did not fit into the key input, but translating this to HEX, you found that it led to "756e627265616b61626c65" which fit into the key input successfully and let theorists pass the finish line.

*That was a lot for BETA GATE 2*
